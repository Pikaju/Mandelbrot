# Mandelbrot

This is a very simple viewer of the Mandelbrot set, which I wrote when I was about 14 years old.
It is entirely written in Java, using only the standard libraries.

## Controls

* Arrow keys - Scroll around through the scene
* E - Zoom in
* D - Zoom out
* Q - Increase the number of iterations (makes the fractal go deeper)
* A - Decrease the number of iterations (higher performance)
* W - Increase resolution (better quality)
* S - Decrease resolution (higher performance)
